# Daily Data Structures and Algorithms in Swift

I'm adding a new data structure or algorithm a day [or trying to :)]. Please email me for requests or suggestions!

**Sorting**
- Radix Sort
- Merge Sort
 
**Data Structures**
- Splay Tree
- Heap
- Graph (Protocol)
 - Adjacency List Graph
 - Pointer Graph (Coming soon)
- Trie
- Stack
- Queue

**Graph: Search**
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (Coming soon)
- A* (Coming soon)

**Graph: Minimum Spanning Tree**
- Prim's Algorithm (Coming soon)
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Bor≈Øvka's Algorithm (Coming soon)
